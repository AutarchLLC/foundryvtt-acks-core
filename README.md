Enter a world where adventurers can become conquerors â€“ and conquerors can become kings.<br/>
Welcome to ACKS II, the new edition of the bestselling fantasy RPG.<br/>
Adventure, conquer, and reign!

Will you survive the perils of war and dark magic to claim a throne?
Or will you meet your fate in a forgotten ruin beyond the ken of men?

This is a world where empires stand on the brink of war, and terrible
monsters tear at the fragile borderlands of men; where decaying cities teem
with chaos and corruption, weeping innocents are sacrificed to chthonic cults
and nobles live in decadent pleasure while the realm burns; where heroes,
wizards, and rogues risk everything in pursuit of glory, fortune, and power.

The Adventurer Conqueror King Systemâ„¢ Imperial Imprint (ACKS II) is the new
edition of the acclaimed bestselling fantasy role-playing game.
Within ACKS II you'll find everything you need to enjoy epic fantasy
campaigns with a sweeping scope. Whether you want to crawl through dungeons,
experiment with alchemy, crossbreed monsters, run a merchant emporium,
raise an undead legion, or conquer an empire, ACKS II supports your playstyle.

## Developer Instructions
### The test suite

There are tests that can be run inside of your Foundry instance through the `acks-tests` module.  To
install the module locally, symlink that folder inside of your Foundry modules folder:
```bash
cd ~/.local/share/FoundryVTT/Data/modules
ln -s ~/path/to/foundryvtt-acks-core/acks-tests acks-tests
```
Once that's done, reload Foundry and you will see "ACKS Test Suite" in your Add-on Modules list.
You'll need to install the [Quench](https://ethaks.github.io/FVTT-Quench/index.html) module too,
which can be done via the built-in module search functionality.

To run the tests, log into a World which is using the ACKS System and go to Manage Modules to enable
ACKS Test Suite.  It will prompt you to enable Quench.

Now that it's installed and enabled, you will see a "ðŸ§ª Quench" button under your chat box. Click
that and the tests will run.  You can also adjust your Quench defaults in the Configure Settings
menu.
