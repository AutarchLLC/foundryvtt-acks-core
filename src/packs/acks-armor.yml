  description: Hide and fur armor is made of stitched-together hair and skin of animals
    layered to a thickness of around 10mm. Unlike leather armor, the skins are not
    hardened with boiling. Hide and fur armor’s only advantages are that it is inexpensive,
    lightweight, and protective against cold.

    armor usually consists of spaulders (shoulder armor), cuirass, and tassets (flaps
    covering the groin and thighs). It is lighter but less protective then more reinforced
    leather armors such as ring mail. A historical example is Late Medieval cuir bouilli.

  description: A set of stylized light armor designed to expose the wearer’s attractive
    form and musculature while fighting. Depending on the wearer’s taste and style,
    light arena armor can include form-fitting cloth or leather; thin straps of mail;
    and/or solitary pieces of plate on the limbs. Historical examples of light arena
    armor include that of the dimachaerus, myrmillo, retiarius, and secutor types.
    Fantasy examples might include Red Sonja’s chain mail bikini, He-Man’s battle
    harness, and most of the armor drawn by Frank Frazetta or Luis Royo. Light arena
    armor can also be used to simulate very partial sets of armor.

type: armor
data:
  description: Ring mail armor is leather or padded armor that has a large number
    of small rings sewn directly over the foundation garment. Unlike chain mail, the
    rings are not physically interlocked with each other, so protection is inferior.
    Ring mail is closely related to scale armor, which sews leather or horn scales
    onto the foundation garment, and provides comparable protection. Historical examples
    include Frankish ring mail, Asian ring armor on leather, and Renaissance eyelet
    doublets.

  description: Scale armor consists of many small leather, cuir bouilli, or horn scales
    attached to a backing material of cloth or leather. Scale armor usually consists
    of a corselet or hauberk worn with leather or padded cloth. It is lighter than
    lamellar armor, which uses metal scales or lames over leather, and comparable
    to ring mail. Historical examples include Scythian scale armor, Egyptian scale
    armor, and early medieval scale armor.

    armors but inferior to metal scale or plate-reinforced armors. Chain mail is commonly
    worn as a shirt and coif, with lighter chain, ring mail, or hardened leather protecting
    the arms and legs and quilted padding below. Historical examples include Viking
    byrnies, Norman mail, and Roman lorica hamata.

  description: Laminated linen armor is made of 20 layers of laminated linen glued
    together to a thickness of 11.5mm. The composite material affords protection comparable
    to mail. Laminated linen armor usually consists of spaulders (shoulder armor),
    cuirass, and tassets (flaps covering the groin and thighs) worn with a bronze
    or iron helmet and pair of greaves. The chief historical example is Macedonian
    linothorax armor.

    Alia’s hauberk in Azure Bonds, and most of the armor seen in Xena: Warrior Princess.

  description: Banded plate armor is made of over-lapping 1mm-thick horizontal strips
    of laminated metal sewn over leather. It is comparable in protection to lamellar
    armor, and superior to chain mail. Banded plate is commonly worn as a cuirass
    with shoulder protection, with reinforced leather protecting the arms and legs.
    The chief historical examples are Sumerian overlapping plate armor and Roman lorica
    segmentata.

  description: Lamellar armor is made of small bronze, iron, or steel plates laced
    together in parallel rows with silk, leather thongs, or cotton. It is similar
    to scale armor, from which it evolved, and comparable in protection to banded
    armor. Lamellar is generally worn as a cuirass over light chain or leather, and
    sometimes sewn to the backing. Lamellar would also include leather lames worn
    over chain. Historical examples include Mongolian lamellar, medieval brigandine
    and splinted armor, Japanese o-yori armor, and Roman lorica squamata.

data:
  description: Plate armor is made from large bronze or iron plates, up to 2mm thick,
    worn over the chest and vital areas. Chain mail or other protective covering might
    cover exposed joints. Plate armor provides superior protection over banded plate
    and lamellar, having larger plates sewn onto a stronger backing. Plate armor is
    scarce in the Auran Empire setting. As the pinnacle of personal protection it
    can only be manufactured by master armorers. Only the dwarves, who have a surplus
    of such smiths, can field large numbers of infantry in plate. The volume of plate
    armor for sale on the Equipment Availability by Market Class table is halved in
    human or elven settlements. Historical examples include archaic panoply (worn
    with pauldrons, vambraces, and greaves), medieval plate- and-mail armor, Middle
    Eastern mirror armor, Eastern European plated mail, and Japanese tatami-do.

    Phyrgian, Boeotian, Attic, and Galean helmets of Antiquity, the medieval bascinet,
    nasal helm, and spangenhelm, and the Renaissance burgonet and sallet.
